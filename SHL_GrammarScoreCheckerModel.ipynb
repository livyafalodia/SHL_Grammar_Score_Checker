        "# The goal of this project is to develop a **Grammar Scoring Engine** that can evaluate spoken English grammar proficiency from audio recordings. The system transcribes speech to text using OpenAI's Whisper model, extracts linguistic features, and predicts a grammar score between 0–5 using a machine learning model.\n",

        "# 1. **Audio Transcription:** Using Whisper for high-quality audio-to-text transcription.\n",
        "# 2. **Text Cleaning & Feature Engineering:** Extract simple statistical text features such as:\n",

        "#    - Word count\n",
        "#    - Average word length\n",

        "# 4. **Evaluation:** RMSE and Pearson Correlation are used to evaluate performance.\n",
        "# 5. **Prediction:** The trained model is used to predict grammar scores for the test dataset.\n",
